*Description*

*This project is a simple yet functional real-time chat application built using React.js for the front-end and WebSockets for real-time communication. It enables users to send and receive messages instantly via a persistent WebSocket connection.

The App component manages the WebSocket lifecycle using React hooks (useState and useEffect). When the component mounts, it connects to a WebSocket server (ws://localhost:5000). Incoming messages are dynamically appended to the chat window, while users can type messages in a text input and send them using a button or by pressing Enter.

The interface is styled using CSS to create a centered layout with a fixed-size scrollable chat window. Each message is neatly displayed with borders and padding for clarity. The input field and send button are styled for a clean and accessible user experience.

This codebase forms a foundational real-time chat interface, ideal for integrating with a backend WebSocket server and expanding with features like usernames, timestamps, or message persistence.*
